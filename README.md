##Introduction
--------------------------------------------------------------

Welcome to the RSA Factoring Challenge! This project is designed to provide a platform for enthusiasts and experts to tackle the RSA factoring problem, a fundamental challenge in the field of cryptography. My name is Akubada Daniel, and I'm excited to have you on board.

##Challenge Description
--------------------------------------------------------------

RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) is a widely used public-key cryptosystem that relies on the difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime numbers. The RSA Factoring Challenge involves attempting to factorize such numbers, emphasizing the importance of secure key generation.
